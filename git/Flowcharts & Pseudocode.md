# Flowcharts & Pseudocode
Flowcharts

*   It provides a visual representation of an algorithm, using symbols to represent flow of input and outputs in a sequence of steps. 
*   It also helps in understanding the algorithm structure and order in which steps should be followed.

Constructs

*   Sequence – Connects multiple steps in a fixed order.
*   Selection – Uses decision points to choose between different branches based on conditions.
*   Iteration – Repeats a set of steps while a particular condition is true.

Types of symbols

*   Decision – Diamond
*   Process –  Rectangle
*   Input/Output – parallelogram
*   Start/Stop – Rugby ball

Pseudocode Syntax

**Definition:** Pseudocode is the description of an algorithm using natural language mixed with sequence, selection and iteration constructs.

*   WHILE - ENDWHILE
*   IF - THEN / ELSE / ENDIF
*   OUTPUT / INPUT
*   FOR - NEXT
