# Computer Architecture
**Parts of computers**

*   **Computer Processors:** The central processing unit (CPU) processes data and follows instructions. It consists of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and the control unit.
*   **Memory:** Stores data, instructions, and results of processing for immediate use. Includes RAM and ROM.
*   **Data and Address Buses:** Data bus transports data between memory and processor; bi-directional. Address bus transports required memory location from processor to memory; uni-directional.
*   **Input and Output:** Input refers to data or instructions received by the computer. Output refers to intermediate or final results produced by the computer.
*   **Storage Media:** Devices used to store large amounts of data that will not be lost when power is interrupted, such as hard disks, SSDs, and optical discs.
*   **Control Unit:** Follows instructions and decides when data should be stored, received, or transmitted by different parts of the computer.
*   **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Processes data by performing basic mathematical and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** | **RAM (Random Access Memory)** | **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** |
| Volatility | Volatile, data is lost when power is off | Non-volatile, data remains when power is off |
| Mutability | Data can be read and written | Data is typically read-only |
| Use | Stores data and instructions temporarily for processing | Stores firmware and bootstrap programs |
| Speed | Faster access for currently used data | Slower compared to RAM |

**Types of Storage Media**

*   Magnetic – Hard Drives
*   Solid-state devices – Solid State Drives
*   Optical Media – CDROM
