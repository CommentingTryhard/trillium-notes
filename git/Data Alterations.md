# Data Alterations
**Data Corruption:** When computer data is made unusable by errors or alterations

**Data Validation:** Ensures input is within algorithm requirements, minimising data corruption and loss due to incorrect and malicious inputs, maintaining data integrity and reducing likelihood of errors during processing.

| **Feature** | **Passwords** | **Biometric Authentication** |
| Security Level | Varies based on complexity | Generally higher due to unique physical traits |
| Ease of Use | Easy but requires memorization | Convenient, no need to remember |
| Risk of Breach | Susceptible to guessing or theft | Harder to replicate or steal |
| Implementation Cost | Low | Higher due to specialized hardware |

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Unauthorized access occurs when someone gains access to data without permission.
*   **Encryption:** Encryption encodes data so that only authorized users with the correct key can read it, protecting it from unauthorized access.
*   **Firewall:** Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, preventing unauthorized access and protecting against external threats.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication:** Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if they know the password.
*   **Antivirus Software:** Antivirus software detects, prevents, and removes malware by scanning files and programs for known threats, preventing them from running, and cleaning infected files.

| **Aspect** | **Proprietary Software** | **Open-Source Software** | **Free Software** |
| Accessibility | Source code is not available to the public | Source code is freely available for use and modification | May or may not have source code available |
| Cost | Often requires purchasing a license | Generally free, though some support services may cost | Free of charge |
| Customization | Limited to the features provided by the developer | Highly customizable due to access to source code | Limited customization, depending on whether source code is available |
