# Algorithms
Algorithms are defined as – Set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem

Example of a simple algorithm: adding two positive whole numbers involves aligning the digits vertically, adding them column by column, carrying over if necessary, and writing the final result

Weird Questions

*   **Explain why algorithms are important in computing:** Algorithms are important because they provide a clear and efficient method for solving problems. They can be used to automate processes, ensure accuracy, and improve the efficiency of computing tasks. Algorithms can be transferred to similar problems.
*   **Input:** Data that is fed into an algorithm for processing
*   **Output:** The result produced by an algorithm after processing the input data.
*   **Decomposing a problem in algorithm design:** Decomposing a problem involves breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Each part can then be solved individually, and the solutions can be combined to solve the original problem. This approach simplifies complex problems and makes them easier to understand and solve.
*   **Decomposition:** Decomposition is the process of **breaking down a complex problem into smaller,** more **manageable** parts that can be **solved individually.**
