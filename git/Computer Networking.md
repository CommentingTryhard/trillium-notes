# Computer Networking
Wireless networks

*   Require no cables, leading to higher mobility
*   Easier to setup and expand the network
*   Low entry cost, will cost higher to scale up

Wired Networks

*   High entry cost, highly scalable
*   Harder to setup and expand
*   Low mobility, every devices requires a physical connection

Network Sizes

*   LAN: Each LAN is a local network, within a small geographical area, and provides the fastest data transfer speeds among the 3 network types.
*   MAN: MANs are within city sized networks, comprising smaller LANs. It provides faster data transfer speeds than a WAN
*   WAN: WANs span the globe, comprising multiple MANs. It provides the slowest data transfer speeds among the 3, due to the long distances data have to travel to reach their destination.

Types of Network Devices

*   Router: Device that forwards and receives packets between separate networks with the use of IP addresses.
*   Hub: Forward packets to all clients that it is connected to
*   Switch: Connects multiple devices within a network and forwards packets to the respective destination device
*   Bridge: Device that connect 2 networks together
*   Modem: Converts data into a form suitable for transmission to another network, and is able to reverse the process for incoming data. (Modulation and Demodulation)
    *   Modulation is the process of converting digital data into a form suitable for transmission over a medium (e.g., converting data into analog signals for telephone lines). Demodulation is the reverse process, converting the received signals back into digital data.
*   NIC: Card that facilitates data transfer for a device to a network.
*   All bridges are switches
    *   Not all switches are bridges

Types of networks

*   Peer to Peer network
    
*   Client Server Network
    *   Centralized data storage and management.
    *   Resource sharing, such as printers and software.
    *   Security and access control.

Checksum

*   A checksum is a calculated value used to verify the integrity of transmitted data. It is computed from the data and sent along with it. The receiver recalculates the checksum and compares it to the sent value to detect errors.
