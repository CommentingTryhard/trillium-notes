# Error Types
**ERRORS**

*   Parallax Errors
    *   This error occurs when the pointer of a device looks like it's at a different reading when read to the side compared to when read face-on.
    *   **BURETTE/MEASURING CYLINDER**
        *   When taking measurements, lower eye level to be in line with the bottom of the water meniscus.
*   Procedure Error / Apparatus Limitation / Measuring Instrument Limitations
    *   This error reflects the accuracy reliability of the measurement value used.
        
        **EXAMPLE OF SUCH ERRORS**
        
        *   Errors Involving length
            *   The 30 cm ruler cannot be held steadily by hand close to the spring, The measurement of length of spring, x has to be estimated.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Clamp the ruler near the spring, so that the ruler need to be held by the hand. This improves the accuracy of the measurements of the length of the spring. 
        *   Errors involving time
            *   The first free oscillations should be ignored because these initial oscillations might not be steady. This affects the measurements of time t. 
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Ignore the first three oscillations, then measure the time taken for the next 20 oscillations. This allows the oscillations to be steady and increases the accuracy of time t.  
                 
            *   Friction between the ball and the wooden plank reduces the speed o the ball. This affects the accuracy of the measurements of time t.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use a smooth plank or lubricate the plank to reduce the effect of friction. This increases the accuracy of time t.
        *   Error involving protractors
            *   It is difficult to consistently align the protractor to the string horizontally. This affects the accuracy of i.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Clamp the protractor with a retort stand, and position the protractor accurately  before taking the measurement.
        *   Errors involving cylinders
            *   The precision of the measuring cylinder is 0.5 cm3. This affects the precision needed for the measurement V.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use a measuring cylinder with precision 0.1 cm3. This increases the sensitivity of the measurement V.
        *   Errors involving springs
            *   As the spring stretches, it may not be possible to find the same reference points to measure length l. Length l cannot be measured in a consistent manner.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Mark two thin lines on the spring as reference points. The length of the spring will be the distance between these thin lines.  
        *   Errors involving newton-meters
            *   The newton meter is setup horizontally instead of vertically. This affects the zero error of the newton meter and affects the accuracy of measurement F. 
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use an electronic newton-meter
        *   Errors involving retort stands
            *   The retort stand provided does not allow small changes to height. Hence, this affects the accuracy of measurement i.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Repeat the experiment a few more times and take the average of the readings, improving the accuracy and reliability of the measurement i.  
                 
            *   The rod is rather thick and the center of the rod cannot be determined consistently. Hence, this affects the accuracy of measurement i.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use a thinner rod. This increases the accuracy of i.
        *   Errors involving optical pins
            *   The holes made by the pins are large, and thus reduces the accuracy of determining the center of the holes for tracing the light ray.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use thinner optical pins. The smaller holes improves accuracy and determining the center of the holes for tracing the light ray.
        *   Errors involving glass blocks
            *   The rectangular glass block makes it hard to replace on the exact position each time it is used. Thus, value of i and d may be inconsistent. 
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use a glass block without the beveled edges, increasing the consistency in positioning the glass block.
        *   Errors involving lens
            *   It is difficult to ensure a sharp image is obtained, especially when x is between 10.0 cm and 20.0 cm, when the edges are not well defined/very small. This affects the accurate measurement of v. 
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use a sufficiently large and bright object, with distinct features to ensure a sharp image is obtained. 
        *   Errors involving electricity.
            *   The wire turns hot after some time, changing the resistance of the wire and hence affecting the value of V. 
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Switch on the circuit for a few seconds before taking a reading and then switch it off immediately, avoiding unnecessary heating in the resistance wire as a change in temperature can affect the resistance.   
                 
            *   There are kinks in the wire
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use a meter rule to straighten out the wires, removing kinks and enabling accurate measurements of l.
        *   Errors involving heat
            *   Heat loss from the hot water to the cooler surrounding, and evaporation can cause the temperature of the hot water to be lower than expected. 
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Cover the beaker with a lid to reduce heat loss. OR Wrap the beaker in a layer of insulation to reduce heat loss.  
                 
            *   The solution was not stirred to ensure the temperature is uniform. This affects the measurement of its temperature.
            *   IMPROVEMENT: Use a glass rod to stir the solution before measuring its temperature.
