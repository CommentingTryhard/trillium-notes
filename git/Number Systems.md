# Number Systems
*   RGB color codes represent colors in digital devices by specifying the intensity of red, green, and blue components. This allows computers to display a wide range of colors on screens.
*   Leading zeros in binary numbers ensure uniform length, which is essential for data alignment, consistency in byte representation, and simplifying binary arithmetic operations. For example, binary numbers in IP addresses or network packets often require leading zeros. 
*   ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) codes represent text in computers, telecommunications, and other devices. They map characters to numerical values, enabling text data to be stored, transmitted, and processed consistently.
*   IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network, enabling data to be routed correctly between them. Without IP addresses, it would be impossible to ensure that data packets reach their intended destinations, resulting in communication failures.
*   Hexadecimal is used in the RGB color model to represent colors by specifying the intensity of red, green, and blue components, each ranging from 00 to FF (0 to 255 in denary). The format is #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB are two-digit hexadecimal values.
